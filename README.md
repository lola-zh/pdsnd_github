## Obtaining insights into bikeshare behaviour in 3 US cities


##### Date created
I created my version of the bikeshare project in April 2019, for the purpose of completing the 2nd assignment for the *udacity* nanodegree **Programming for Data Science**. The README file was subsequently created in May 2019 for the 3rd assignment on Version Control.


### Description
The project uses Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the USâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Project steps can roughly be divided in 2 categories:
* Writing code to import the data and answer questions about it by computing descriptive statistics
* Writing a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics

### Files used
The project comprised:
* a **py.file** with the python code for data import, descriptive statistics, and the script
* three csv files containing the underlying data, already cleaned. *note:* The files are not uploaded to Github in order to maintain speed.

### Credits
For reference I reviewed the following approaches:
* https://github.com/xhlow/udacity-bikeshare-project
* https://github.com/antra0497/Udacity-Project-Bike-Share-Analysis

In addition, I relied on [stackoverflow] (https://stackoverflow.com/) for overall questions on how to write the python code, command line etc.
